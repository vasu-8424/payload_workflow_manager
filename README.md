## üîß API Endpoints

### Workflow Management
```bash
# Trigger workflow on a document
POST /api/workflows/trigger
{
  "documentId": "doc-id",
  "collectionSlug": "blogs"
}

# Get workflow status
GET /api/workflows/status/:docId?collection=blogs

# Process workflow action
POST /api/workflows/action
{
  "documentId": "doc-id",
  "collectionSlug": "blogs",
  "stepIndex": 0,
  "action": "approve",
  "comment": "Optional comment"
}
```

### Development
```bash
# Seed database
POST /api/seed
```

## üìñ Sample Workflows

### 1. Blog Publication Workflow
- **Step 1**: Content Review (Reviewer role)
- **Step 2**: Manager Approval (Manager role)
- **Auto-start**: When blog is created with workflow assigned

### 2. Contract Approval Workflow
- **Trigger**: Contracts with amount > $10,000
- **Step 1**: Legal Review (Reviewer role)
- **Step 2**: Executive Approval (Manager role)
- **Conditions**: Only applies to high-value contracts

## üé• Demo Walkthrough

### Creating a Workflow
1. Navigate to Admin Panel ‚Üí Workflows
2. Click "Create New"
3. Configure workflow settings:
   - Name and description
   - Target collections
   - Step definitions
   - Assignee rules
   - Conditions and actions

### Testing Workflow
1. Create a new blog post or contract
2. Assign a workflow to the document
3. Save the document (triggers workflow)
4. View workflow status in the document edit view
5. Process approvals/rejections as assigned users

## üöÄ Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

1. **Prepare for Deployment**
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build
```

2. **Environment Variables**
Set these in your Vercel dashboard:
- `MONGODB_URI`
- `PAYLOAD_SECRET`
- `PAYLOAD_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL`

3. **Deploy**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel
```

### Other Platforms
The application can be deployed to any Node.js hosting platform:
- Heroku
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Google Cloud Run

## üîí Security Features

- **Role-based Access Control**: Users can only access workflows they're assigned to
- **Immutable Audit Trail**: Workflow logs cannot be modified or deleted
- **Condition Validation**: All workflow conditions are validated before execution
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized and validated

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Collections
1. Create collection in `src/collections/`
2. Add workflow fields:
   ```typescript
   {
     name: 'workflow',
     type: 'relationship',
     relationTo: 'workflows',
   },
   {
     name: 'workflowStatus',
     type: 'group',
     fields: [
       { name: 'currentStep', type: 'number' },
       { name: 'isActive', type: 'checkbox' },
       { name: 'lastUpdated', type: 'date' },
     ],
   }
   ```
3. Add collection to workflow plugin configuration

### Custom Step Types
1. Extend the `WorkflowStep` interface
2. Add step type to the workflow plugin
3. Implement step-specific logic in the workflow engine

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MongoDB Connection Error**
   - Verify MongoDB is running
   - Check connection string in `.env`
   - Ensure network access if using cloud MongoDB

2. **Workflow Not Triggering**
   - Check if workflow is active
   - Verify collection assignment
   - Check workflow conditions

3. **Admin Panel Not Loading**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check console for errors
   - Verify PAYLOAD_SECRET is set

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable debug logging
DEBUG=payload:* npm run dev
```

# WeframeTech Backend Hiring Task ‚Äì Advanced Payload CMS Challenge

## Loom Video Script & Checklist

### 1. Introduction (with your face visible)
Hi, my name is [Your Name]. I'm a backend developer, and this is my submission for the WeframeTech advanced Payload CMS workflow challenge. I'll walk you through my approach, the architecture, a live demo, and some of the technical challenges I faced.

### 2. Architecture Explanation (show your code structure)
- `src/collections`: Main collections (`Blogs`, `Contracts`, `Users`, `Workflows`, `WorkflowLogs`, `Media`).
- `src/plugins/workflow-plugin.ts`: Core workflow logic, dynamic and reusable for any collection.
- `src/admin/components/WorkflowStatus.tsx`: Custom admin UI for workflow status and actions.
- `src/index.ts`: Main server and custom API endpoints.
- `src/payload.config.ts`: Registers collections and plugins.

### 3. Live Demo (create a workflow, assign it, test approval process)
- Log in as admin and create a workflow with multiple steps (assign to users/roles, set conditions, step types).
- Attach workflow to a document (e.g., Contract).
- Update the document to trigger workflow progression; only assigned users can act at each step.
- View workflow status and logs in the custom admin UI tab.
- Demonstrate inline actions (approve/reject/comment) and show immutable audit trail.

### 4. Technical Challenges and Solutions
- Making the workflow engine dynamic for any collection using Payload's plugin system and dynamic slugs.
- Customizing the admin UI with Payload's `admin.components` override system.
- Ensuring audit trail immutability with Payload hooks.

### 5. Bonus Features (if any)
- Conditional branching between steps based on outcomes.
- SLA timers for steps and auto-escalation if overdue.
- Email notifications simulated with console logs.

### 6. Deployment Demonstration
- Project is deployed on [Render/Vercel].
- Live admin panel and custom API endpoints are demonstrated.
- Deployment process is documented below.

### 7. Credentials and Sample Data
- Demo credentials for admin and reviewer roles are included below.
- Database is seeded with sample Blog and Contract documents.

### 8. Closing
Thank you for reviewing my submission. I enjoyed working on this challenge and learned a lot about Payload CMS. Please let me know if you have any questions!
